I am glad that I would be collaborating with the great community of Jderobot. It's a great motivation in working with such a group and sharing their passion for developing intelligent robotics applications.

## Preliminaries

I have already been working on this [Pull request](https://github.com/JdeRobot/BehaviorMetrics/pull/157). I am going to set up this blog where I can write my progress. This [repository](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/gsoc2021-Utkarsh_Mishra) is going to have  code and documentation for my project in addition to contributing directly into the primary repository of [Behavior Metrics](https://github.com/JdeRobot/BehaviorMetrics).

I am setting up this blog [template](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/colab-gsoc2020-Diego_Charrez) which I think is appropriate and I am excited to use it for the project. Also, it is well organized and easy to personalize.

## Objectives

- Getting Familiar with the existing code base.
- Recognizing and Documenting potential breaks and redundancies in existing pipeline.
- Literature Review of Pilot-Net and DeepPilot-CNN.
- Reproduce DeepPilot-CNN in PyTorch
