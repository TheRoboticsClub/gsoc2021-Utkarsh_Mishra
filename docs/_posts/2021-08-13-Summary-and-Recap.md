This has been a great journey and so far. Below you will find a concise summary of my contribution to the JdeRobot community as a Google Summer of Code student.

## PyTorch Extension to Behavior Metrics

Before GSoC 2021, Behavior Metrics used to support Tensorflow based brains. My contributions included implementing and extending all the necessary components to support PyTorch based brains. This started from the community bonding period and I was able to implement both the Deep Learning and Reinforcement learning algorithms. You can refer to the following:
